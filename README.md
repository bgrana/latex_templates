# LateX Templates

This repository holds several latex templates that I usually need for reports and projects. I also has building tools to create a new LateX project in the given location with the selected template.

# Templates

The following templates are available:

* **Title:** You can choose between having a title page with the title, authors, date and posibly an image, or having the title and authors in the first page of text.
* **Long report:** Uses chapters and has an index as well as a figure index.
* **Short report:** Uses sections directly and has no indices.
* **Paper:** Like a short report but with two columns format.

# Usage

Run the following command in the latex_templates folder to initiate the interactive template builder.

```
./build.py
```
